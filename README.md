# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 A Machine Learning Model to Predict Flight Delays Based on Various Factors

📜 Overview
Flight delays can cause inconvenience to passengers and disrupt airline operations. This project uses Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a flight will be delayed based on multiple factors like airline, departure airport, arrival airport, weather conditions, and departure time.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
Google Colab (Development)
📂 Dataset
Since no direct dataset was used, a synthetic dataset was generated with the following features:

Flight_Number: Random flight numbers
Airline: Airline codes (AA, DL, UA, SW, BA, LH)
Departure_Airport: Major U.S. airports (JFK, LAX, ORD, DFW, ATL)
Arrival_Airport: Destination airports (JFK, LAX, ORD, DFW, ATL)
Scheduled_Departure: Hour of the day (0-23)
Weather_Condition: Clear, Rain, Fog, Storm
Delay: Target variable (1 = Delayed, 0 = On Time)
📊 Data Preprocessing
Categorical Encoding: One-hot encoding was used for categorical variables like airline, airports, and weather conditions.
Feature Selection: The target variable Delay was separated, and features were selected accordingly.
Train-Test Split: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing.
🚀 Model Training
Used Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators for better performance.
Trained on the processed dataset and evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix
📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy in predicting flight delays.
Confusion matrix visualization provided insights into misclassifications.
